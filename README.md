![alt text](https://github.com/GAbrielchapo/N-puzzle/image.jpg?raw=true)

The objective is to implement different search algorithms to resolve a N-Puzzle.

## Getting Started

Generate a map:

```
python2 generator.py 3 -s > map
```

Solve the map:

```
python3.7 main.py map
```

## Chose between 3 algorithms:
### A* algorithm
### greedy search
### uniform-cost search


## and chose between 3 heuristics (except for uniform-cost)
### manhattan distance
### euclidian distance
### tiles out of place distance
