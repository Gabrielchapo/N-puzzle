# N-puzzle resolver

The objective is to implement different search algorithms to resolve a N-Puzzle.

## Getting Started

Generate a map:

```
python2 generator.py 3 -s > map
```

Solve the map:

```
python3.7 main.py map
```

## Chose between 
### A* algorithm
### greedy search
### uniform-cost search

## and chose between
### manhattan distance
### euclidian distance
### tiles out of place distance
